  //New Festival Dialogue
  //Victor
  "Victor.Egg2": "Egg hunting again this year, eh?$1#$e#What do they do with all those eggs afterward, anyway?",
  "Victor.Flower2": "Dancing, dancing, always dancing...$1#$e#I swear I was born with two left feet.",
  "Victor.Luau2": "The soup at the luau is always good, but all soup is better with noodles.$1#$e#I could throw my own in? Hm...",
  "Victor.Jellyfish2": "The way that all the moonlight jellies move in unison...$1#$e#It's almost hypnotic, isn't it?",
  "Victor.Fair2": "I'm not touching any of the games of chance. I already know how my luck goes.$1#$e#Orange, green, it'll be a loss for me no matter what.",
  "Victor.Halloween2": "Do you think they can train these monsters to do anything?$1#$e#Maybe you could have them do your farmwork.",
  "Victor.Ice2": "I wonder exactly how many fish there are in the ponds around here? They seem to be endless.",
  "Victor.Christmas2": "Sometimes I dream of seeing a bridge I designed decked out in lights, with the snow settling along it.$1#$e#This really is a beautiful season.",
  //Morgan
  "Morgan.Egg2": "Oooh, how many eggs do you think I can find?$1#$e#I'm going to become your greatest competition!",
  "Morgan.Flower2": "Someday I hope I can learn magic that'll let me grow the flowers till they're *huge.*",
  "Morgan.Luau2": "Do you think anyone will notice if I take an extra serving of soup?$1#$e#Don't look at me like that. Studying is hard work!",
  "Morgan.Jellyfish2": "Do you think the jellies glow because of magic?$1#$e#I dunno what kind of magic that'd be.",
  "Morgan.Fair2": "Welwick is soooo boring. I want to go play fair games!$1",
  "Morgan.Halloween2": "What do you think of.. curses?$1#$e#After what his ex-wife did, the Wizard won't talk about them at all.",
  "Morgan.Ice2": "I want to make a snowperson who looks just like me!",
  "Morgan.Christmas2": "Merry Winter Star, @!$1#$e#Doesn't the town look so nice?",
  //Lance
  "Lance.Egg2": "No, I will not be hunting for eggs.$1#$e#I would be too tempted to fight for them.",
  "Lance.Flower2": "I did study dancing, long ago...$1#$e#Well, I took one class, anyway.",
  "Lance.Luau2": "I hope the Governor's journey here wasn't troubled by anything.$1#$e#Usually, they hire mercenaries to clear out the path ahead of time.",
  "Lance.Jellyfish2": "You know, it's likely there are monsters with powers we can't even fathom far below the sea's surface.$1#$e#It's an intriguing thing to imagine.$1#$e#Yes, yes, I'm enjoying the jellies, too.",
  "Lance.Fair2": "I look forward to seeing what you have to offer in your grange display.$1#$e#You never fail to amaze me with the things you produce on your farm.",
  "Lance.Halloween2": "Have the monsters ever managed to escape during this festival? Hmm..$1#$e#That's a question for Magnus.",
  "Lance.Ice2": "The weather turning at this time of year makes me want to set off on a journey to somewhere warmer.$1#$e#The perks of being an adventurer.",
  "Lance.Christmas2": "The spirit of this town feels strongest at this festival, I think.$1#$e#It's the kind of camaraderie that only a small town can produce, where everyone cares for each other.",
  //Claire
  "Claire.Egg2": "Deviled eggs, eggs over easy, poached eggs, egg-in-the-hole...$1#$e#I like eggs.",
  "Claire.Flower2": "I did study dancing, long ago...$1#$e#Well, I took one class, anyway.",
  "Claire.Luau2": "I hope the Governor's journey here wasn't troubled by anything.$1#$e#Usually, they hire mercenaries to clear out the path ahead of time.",
  "Claire.Jellyfish2": "Watching the lights of the jellies disappear into the darkness...it always makes me feel a little bittersweet.$1#$e#No, it's not bad, just...complicated.",
  "Claire.Fair2": "I can't believe Marnie manages to take care of so many animals!$1#$e#I'm sure Shane and Jas help her. You can see how well taken care of they are.",
  "Claire.Halloween2": "Fall food is the best because it's so warming!$1#$e#Mulled wine...pumpkin spices...hot apple cider...$2#$e#Claire is lost in thoughts of food.",
  "Claire.Ice2": "I d-d-don't know if I'll m-m-m-make it for the wh-whole c-c-competition.",
  "Claire.Christmas2": "Giving a good gift is even better than receiving one, I think.$1#$e#There's just something so special about seeing people's faces light up.",
  //Susan
  "Susan.Egg2": "It's great that the kids have so much fun. And it's fun for me, too, to watch them all scurry around.",
  "Susan.Flower2": "Oh, me? Dance?$1#$e#My moves might look a bit silly next to the young people's.",
  "Susan.Luau2": "I hope the governor appreciates how hard we all work to keep this place special.$1#$e#And not just for this festival, either.",
  "Susan.Jellyfish2": "No, I'm very happy on the sand, thank you.$1#$e#The jellies look just as nice from far away.",
  "Susan.Fair2": "Are you my competition, @?$1#$e#It'll be a close one, then! Experience versus the energy of youth.",
  "Susan.Halloween2": "Hm...I hope the children are safe around these monsters.$1#$e#I know the wizard wouldn't put them in harm's way intentionally, but still.",
  "Susan.Ice2": "Did you ever go fishing when you were younger, honey?$1#$e#It was a much different time when I was young. There wasn't as much trash to fish up.",
  "Susan.Christmas2": "Ahh, look at everyone with their rosy cheeks and their bright smiles.$1#$e#I'm glad I set myself up on my little farm here. And that you did on yours, honey.",
  //Andy
  "Andy.Egg2": "Where d'you think they get all those eggs, anyhow?$1#$e#Marnie'd be takin' a big hit if she's donatin' 'em all.",
  "Andy.Flower2": "Feels weird to have all these people flappin' around in the woods.$1#$e#I get used to havin' 'em mostly to myself.",
  "Andy.Luau2": "Whaddaya think the governor thinks of this place, anyway?$1#$e#Not the pretty speeches he makes, I mean truthfully.",
  "Andy.Jellyfish2": "Everyone talks about this like they're havin' some kind of spiritual experience, but I dunno.$1#$e#They're just weird glowin' blobs.",
  "Andy.Fair2": "Well, I gotta admit... seein' the work of all these other farmers does make me wanna do better.$1#$e#If only because their produce is gonna outsell mine.",
  "Andy.Halloween2": "You ain't gonna catch me in that maze when there's this much food to get through.$1#$e#Scared? Nah.",
  "Andy.Ice2": "If they let you bring home the fish you catch, you should fry 'em up.",
  "Andy.Christmas2": "There's nobody here who knows enough about me to get me a gift I want, and the same goes for them.$1#$e#Sorry. Don't mean to bring down the mood.",
  //Scarlett
  "Scarlett.Egg2": "You think they ever forget to pick up some of the eggs? It'd put up a mighty stink in a month or so.",
  "Scarlett.Flower2": "The little flower crowns people wear here sometimes are so darn cute.$1#$e#Maybe I'll make one for myself later.",
  "Scarlett.Luau2": "Mmm, it's nice to have someone else do the cooking for me for once!",
  "Scarlett.Jellyfish2": "I love watchin' these little guys twinkling in the sea.$1#$e#We see them in Grampleton, but I think you get more here.",
  "Scarlett.Fair2": "Of course you know I hafta root for Sophia over you. Nothing personal!",
  "Scarlett.Halloween2": "The maze this year is tough!$1#$e#Maybe I can just strategically follow someone...?",
  "Scarlett.Ice2": "Brrr...you aren't too cold for fishing, @?$1#$e#I feel like my hands are so numb I'd drop the fishing rod.",
  "Scarlett.Christmas2": "This present has my name on it!$1#$e#Back home we do a gift exchange just like this, too.",
  //Olivia
  "Olivia.Egg2": "The egg hunt again, hmm?$1#$e#I hope it remains challenging for you year after year, darling.",
  "Olivia.Flower2": "Isn't it nice to have a community that takes the time to get together?$1#$e#I prefer to dance to something a little more upbeat, though.",
  "Olivia.Luau2": "Did you know, sweetie? Adding a little bit of sherry to some kinds of soups can make them taste extra delicious.$1#$e#And balsamic vinegar makes anything at all better.",
  "Olivia.Jellyfish2": "This is a very special kind of romantic, isn't it?$1#$e#There's nothing like this in the city.",
  "Olivia.Fair2": "Do they ever offer samples from the grange displays here?$1#$e#I'd love to take some local produce home and whip something special up.",
  "Olivia.Halloween2": "Happy Spirit's Eve, honey. Come on and sit and have a drink with me.$1#$e#You'll need it to help boost your courage for the maze.",
  "Olivia.Ice2": "All these snowmen are charming little creatures.$1#$e#But is seeing them worth the cold? Mmm...for a little while, at least.",
  "Olivia.Christmas2": "Merry Winter Star, @. May you get a gift you love today and ring in the new year with joy.",
  //Marlon
  "Marlon.Egg2": "Everyone's emerging from their winter hibernation. It's good to see all their faces.",
  "Marlon.Flower2": "I like having an excuse to come out and be in the forest.$1#$e#I spend too much time cooped up in the guild.",
  "Marlon.Luau2": "I'm just going to take some space from everyone.$1#$e#The heat makes me a little light-headed.",
  "Marlon.Jellyfish2": "I wonder if the glowing jellyfish have stingers, too.$1#$e#Getting stung by a jellyfish is nasty. Avoid it if you can.",
  "Marlon.Fair2": "I only buy eggs and milk from Marnie's ranch.$1#$e#I hope she notices.",
  "Marlon.Halloween2": "When we catch these monsters, we have to figure out a balance between which will be interesting to look at, and which are safe enough to keep in the town.$1#$e#No matter how strong the cages are, you have to be prepared.",
  "Marlon.Ice2": "Some of these snowmen remind me of the monsters around here.$1#$e#Hopefully the young people don't see too many of them.",
  "Marlon.Christmas2": "Merry Winter Star, @. $1#$e#I hope you've found your place in this town.",
  //Gunther
  "Gunther.Egg2": "How did a festival dedicated to eggs come into being in the first place, do you think...? We only have theories.$1#$e#Local customs are always strange to unpick.",
  "Gunther.Flower2": "The research we have about this dance suggests that it goes back hundreds of years.$1#$e#It's amazing how much stays the same over time in small towns like this one.",
  "Gunther.Luau2": "If the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, then this soup will be magnificent.",
  "Gunther.Jellyfish2": "No one understands precisely how the jellies get their glow, but research suggests that it's a combination of both biology and magic.",
  "Gunther.Fair2": "Do you prefer to perfect a few things on your farm and display the same ones every year? Or do you expand and show off the breadth of your farm's potential?$1#$e#Either way, you put on a formidable showing.",
  "Gunther.Halloween2": "This is the festival where the town looks most different from its usual self.$1#$e#Many things could lurk in the shadows.",
  "Gunther.Ice2": "Every inch of this valley has its own fascinating history.$1#$e#And the snow layers over it and hides it all. It's a strange feeling.",
  "Gunther.Christmas2": "May you have a very merry Winter Star.$1#$e#The tree looks larger than usual this year, I think.",
  //Martin
  "Martin.Egg2": "I wish I could egg-hunt too.$1#$e#I'm worried that I'll be no good at it.",
  "Martin.Flower2": "I've never even tried to dance.$1#$e#No, I don't want to learn! Not yet...",
  "Martin.Luau2": "There's so many things to eat here, I can hardly pick!$1#$e#That's it. I'm not gonna pick, I'm gonna try it all.",
  "Martin.Jellyfish2": "I never saw the jellies before I came to Pelican Town! We're way too far out from the ocean at home.",
  "Martin.Fair2": "Best of luck in the contest, @!$1#$e#Maybe someday I'll put up a grange display of my own.",
  "Martin.Halloween2": "Is it technically cheating to just climb over top of the maze?$1#$e#I'd prove that I'm *really* good at climbing.",
  "Martin.Ice2": "I'm gonna make the most powerful snowman the world has ever seen.",
  "Martin.Christmas2": "For my gift, I want...$1#$e#I'm not gonna tell you or my wish might not come true!",
  //Sophia
  "Sophia.Egg2": "I'm determined to give the egg hunt my all!$9#$e#I hope all the food I ate doesn't slow me down.$1",
  "Sophia.Flower2": "I'm trying to watch where I step... I wouldn't want to accidentally squish a flower!$1#$e#Did you know bumblebees are pettable?$9",
  "Sophia.Luau2": "There was a seagull that looked like it hadn't eaten in days. I caved in and gave it a few nibbles from the festival goodies!$1",
  "Sophia.Jellyfish2": "Moonlight jellies are kind of like floating lanterns in the ocean. They're so pretty!$1",
  "Sophia.Fair2": "Something smells good... I hope Lewis judges our grange displays soon so I can grab a bite to eat!$1#$e#Did you set up your display yet?$9",
  "Sophia.Halloween2": "The maze this year is really testing my sense of direction. I'm getting all turned around...$0",
  "Sophia.Ice2": "I spotted a fluffy snow rabbit while we were walking to the ice fishing spot through the woods. They're just so cute!$1",
  "Sophia.Christmas2": "This is my third cup of hot cocoa!$9",
  //Sandy
  "Sandy.Egg2": "Why hello there, sweetie. Emily invited me to the egg festival, and I couldn't pass up the chance, so I took the day off work.$0#$e#This is something I wouldn't miss for anything!$1",
  "Sandy.Flower2": "Your town's blacksmith surprised me with a lovely bouquet of flowers. Isn't that sweet?$0",
  "Sandy.Luau2": "Ah... the refreshing scent of the ocean breeze is a treat I can't really enjoy back home.$0",
  "Sandy.Jellyfish2": "The soothing sound of ocean waves is something I could listen to endlessly...$0",
  "Sandy.Halloween2": "I suspect there's a secret route concealed somewhere... but where might it be?$0#$e#Your town's magic practitioner outdid themselves.$1",
  "Sandy.Ice2": "I'm really not accustomed to this freezing temperature.$2",
  "Sandy.Christmas2": "Happy holidays, sweetie. I wish you great health and a successful springtime on %farm Farm.$0",
  //Morris
  "Morris.Egg2": "The eggs this year are proudly sponsored by Joja! They're made from top-quality plastic materials.$1",
  "Morris.Flower2": "The valley's dance ceremony remains quite unfamiliar to me, but I understand it holds a deep significance for the community.$0",
  "Morris.Luau2": "The governor has set high standards for the soup this year, farmer @. I'm confident we'll see impressive results with help from %farm Farm!$4",
  "Morris.Jellyfish2": "It's instances like this that highlight the importance of community to me. I'm proud to represent the valley as its mayor!$1",
  "Morris.Fair2": "The Stardew Valley Fair has been a complete success today! We've managed to raise a considerable sum of money!$1",
  "Morris.Halloween2": "I'm unsure what sorcery is needed to conjure a maze like this... but it brings joy to the townsfolk!$0",
  "Morris.Ice2": "I need to contact the Joja contractor who constructed my townhouse. This area would greatly benefit from the addition of cabins.$0#$e#It's a long trek out here and the townsfolk get tired. I believe if there were proper lodging it'd improve the spirit of the Ice Festival.$1",
  "Morris.Christmas2": "I entrusted Lewis with managing today's festivities, and he's exceeded expectations! I'm confident I made the perfect choice in selecting him as festival coordinator.$0",
  //DESERT FESTIVAL
  "DesertFestival_Sophia": "I'm struggling between what to get. Maybe I'll just close my eyes and point at the menu!$1",
  "DesertFestival_Susan": "I purchased the cutest baby cactus from the strange man down those stairs. This green spiky guy has what I would say... a unique personality!$0",
  "DesertFestival_Andy": "I ain't got no idea of mind why anyone would want to settle down in a desert. Not enough shade for miles!$0",
