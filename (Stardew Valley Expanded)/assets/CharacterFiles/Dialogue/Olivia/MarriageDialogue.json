  "spouseRoom_Olivia": "I'm trying some Gotoran painting techniques I read about, but they're giving me some trouble.$0#$e#Maybe I should ask Leah for some help. I hate to bother her with amateur questions, but...$6#$b#If I can master these techniques, I can paint a truly moving portrait of you, sweetie. I'd like to do that.$4",
  "funReturn_Olivia": "Did you have a good day today?$0#$e#I found a bottle of some rare wine I've wanted to try up for auction, and managed to snag it for a great price.$3#$b#We'll have to find something to celebrate, so we have an excuse to open it.$1",
  "funLeave_Olivia": "Good morning, honey.$3",
  "OneKid_0": "I took my eye off %kid1 for a moment today, and they managed to get into my painting supplies!$6#$b#Our walls narrowly escaped an explosion of creativity.$1#$e#Maybe %kid1 will grow up to be a painter, too...$3",
  "OneKid_1": "Storytime with %kid1 today was so much fun, @! We took turns being animals in the jungle and making noises.$1#$e#$I'd forgotten what fun it can be, raising a child this young. They see the world very differently.$0",
  "OneKid_2": "%kid1 has been quite the handful today. We had a record-breaking tantrum at naptime.$6#$b#Victor never threw tantrums. Maybe they get it from you, honey...$2#$b#What were you like as a child, I wonder?$4",
  "OneKid_3": "%kid1 reminds me so much of Victor at this age. So fond of listening to stories.$1",

  "TwoKids_1": "Today, %kid1 and %kid2 got into a little tussle.$6#$e#Don't worry, it all worked out for the best. They love each other very much.$3#$b#But now that you're here, sweetie, I could use a break...$1",
  "TwoKids_2": "You know, after Victor, I swore off having children, but I don't regret starting a family with you at all.$3#$b#This is a new chapter for me, and I'm so happy to be living it with you.$1",
  "TwoKids_3": "I really love our little family here, sweetie.$1#$b#Let's try to all go out together soon when you aren't too busy with work. Maybe to the beach, or the park? Victor can come too.$3",
  "TwoKids_4": "Two kids at once are certainly a lot to manage. I could hardly keep up with them today.$6#$e#I'm not as young as I used to be, @.$2#$b#...I hope that doesn't bother you...$2#$e#You hug Olivia.#$e#!!!$9",

  "_COMMENT2": "SEASONAL DIALOGUE",
  "spring_Olivia": "As much as I miss the hustle and bustle of the city, I do love the valley in the spring.$3#$e#Before we moved here, I'd never tasted such clean air.$1#$b#Let's take a walk around the woods later if you aren't too busy. I love to see everything starting to grow again.$3",
  "spring_1": "Spring is here, sweetie! I opened a nice bottle of a dry white wine for us to celebrate.$1#$e#In the spring, you don't want to drink anything too heavy or too sweet.$6#$e#It should be like the flowers, fresh and just beginning to bloom.$3",
  "spring_13": "Are you participating in the egg hunt today, honey?$6#$e#I know you like to win, but it might be nice for you and Abigail to give the younger ones a chance.$6",
  "spring_24": "I can't decide which dress I should choose for the dance today.$1#$b#I want to make sure it goes well with what you're wearing.$3#$b#I wish we went dancing more. It's so enchanting, being in your arms, listening to beautiful songs and surrounded by friends.$8",
  "summer_Olivia": "My, it's warm today, isn't it?$3#$b#I'd like to go paint somewhere scenic. Maybe by the sea, so I can take a break and go for a dip if it gets too hot!$1",
  "summer_1": "Have you figured out what you'll be planting this season, sweetie? I want to send some of this summer's crops back home to my parents.$0#$e#They don't believe me when I tell them I'm living on a farm!$3",
  "summer_11": "I know you'll call me a fanatic, honey, but you should think about adding a little red wine to the festival soup.$6#$e#A little wine in soup makes the flavor nice and rich. It's good for more than just drinking!$3",
  "summer_28": "Truthfully, the jellies make me a little nervous. They can sting, you know.$2#$e#It'll be romantic as long as you're there to hold my hand.$3",

  "fall_1": "I want to paint the leaves changing in Cindersap Forest. That way, we can remember how the autumn looks all year long.$3#$e#It's a great opportunity to learn how to use colors with more nuance. And what a lovely painting it would be, if done well!$1",
  "fall_16": "I hope your display does well today.$3#$b#I know how hard you've worked to put together a fantastic representation of your work. I'm sure the mayor will agree.$1",
  "fall_27": "I confess I don't really see the appeal of Spirit's Eve. The things that are meant to be scary always just seem a little silly.$0#$e#And many of the decorations are just a bit...tacky.$2",
  "winter_Olivia": "I look forward to the days I do yoga, especially at this time of year. I get so stiff in the winter.$0#$e#I'd never call myself old, but these last few years I've really felt the cold weather.$2",

  "_COMMENT3": "DAY DIALOGUE",
  "Indoor_Day_0": "I'm feeling lazy today. I'm tempted to just stay inside and read.$6#$e#I do miss our library sometimes. I could pick any shelf and find a fascinating story to disappear into for hours.$3",
  "Indoor_Day_1": "Can we get a bigger tv, honey?$0#$b#We have enough space, and it'd be nice in the evenings.$1",
  "Indoor_Day_2": "The other day, I found a mouse, sweetie. A mouse!$0",

  "Rainy_Day_0": "Rain in the city felt so different. It was in everyone's way.$0#$b#Here, the rain is good for the crops and makes the landscape glow. It's not what I'm used to, but it's nice.$3",
  "Rainy_Day_1": "Rainy days are a red wine kind of day, don't you think?$0#$b#A little wine can boost your immune system against things like colds, you know.$3",
  "Rainy_Day_2": "On gloomy days, I just try to remember that this weather is good for the plants. I find it so dreary, though...$0#$e#Don't stay out too late, sweetie. I could use some company today.$3",
  "Rainy_Day_3": "The moisture in the air on days like this makes it hard to paint. It stays wet for ages, and everything takes longer.$2#$b#I suppose I'll have to find something else to occupy my time.$0",

  "Neutral_0": "Can we take a trip to the desert sometime?$3#$e#I'd like to try some fresh cactus fruit.$1",
